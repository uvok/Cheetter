This is an twitter-client in development.
It's still in progress.

Notice that consumer and consumer-keys aren't added here, as I don't think it's a good idea to make them public,
on the other hand I have no idea how to store them "secretly", so nobody can see them (don't think that's possible,
though).

For console. Written using python-twitter library
