This is an twitter-client in development.
It's still in progress.

Notice that consumer and consumer-keys aren't added here, as I don't think it's a good idea to make them public,
on the other hand I have no idea how to store them "secretly", so nobody can see them (don't think that's possible,
though).

For console. Written using python-twitter library

-
This client uses python-twitter momentarily, but will *very soon* start using my own clone of the library:
http://code.google.com/r/uvokch337ah-python-twitter-lists

This is because the python-twitter library doesn't support list statuses yet, but this ais a very important feature to me.
